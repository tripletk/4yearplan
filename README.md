## Inspiration
College tuition is higher than ever, which makes graduating on a schedule more important now than ever before. We believe that an online web application can help students create a course plan for their four years at college in a way that is easy, intuitive, and fast.

## What it does
First, you can manually add in courses with information or download a set of courses associated with your college. Then, you can drag and create a four-year plan. Finally, you can save, download, export, and later reload your plan right where you left off.

## How we built it
We used Figma to design the front end of the document which was then implemented in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. The backend was a Node.js and Express server that used Firebase Admin, Firebase Auth, and Cloud Firestore.

## Challenges we ran into
Being a group of inexperienced developers we had to learn different skills and technologies that made our web app unique. On the frontend, the draggable and droppable course cards was a major hurdle we were able to implement. On the backend, working with user authentication and authentication persistence as well as Cloud Firestore to preserve courses and user data was challenge as we had never worked with Firebase before.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are truly proud of being able to get as far as we did with the small amount of experience we had. It was a lot of work trying to get the features we wanted to make it a working product.

What we learned
From working with dynamic frontend to a Node.js express server as well as working with Firebase, we all gained new skills and are confident in our newfound abilities to work with these technologies.

What's next for Four Year Plan
The possibilities are endless. Features such as export to PDF or sharing will allow it to be an even powerful and useful tool for students.
